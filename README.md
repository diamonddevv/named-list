# named-list
_Forked from [dominictarr/random-name](https://github.com/dominictarr/random-name)_

Literally **just** a list of forenames, middlenames and surnames. \
May receive updates.

### Removed from original repository:
- Place Names
- Javascript Code Snippets and Node.JS related files
- JSON files

## Data Sources (Where the original lists of names came from)
### Disclaimers:
_I take no ownership over the original lists of names. The lists take from several datasets, and are merged together to create a definitive list of names. (Hopefully) There are no reoccurences of any name within the same file, however certain names may appear in multiple. For example, 'William' could be a forename, middle name and a surname. These are not exhaustive lists - there may be names that do not appear. Entries marked 'something/somethingelse' are GitHub repositories, unless otherwise stated._

### **Forenames**

### **Middle Names**

### **Surnames**
    - dominictarr/random-name




## Licensing
_Originally identical to dominictarr/random-name. Because all code from that repository was removed and names were isolated, i am marking this as unlicensed and in the public domain. The lists of names are from several other sources and have been merged, and as they are just names, i doubt that they alone can be copyrighted._

Public Domain - Feel free to use these lists as you wish, create scripts to grab names from the raw text, whatever.
